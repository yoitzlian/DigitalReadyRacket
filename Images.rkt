; For this assignment, we will be making
; an image of a snowman.
(require 2htdp/image)

#| Question 1:
Make a solid white circle with a radius of 50

Save this circle as a variable called "base"
|#
(define base (circle 50 "solid" "White"))
#| Question 2:
Make an outlined black circle with a radius of 5

Save this circle as a variable called "eye"
|#
(define eye (circle 5 "outline" "black"))
#| Question 3:
Using the overlay function, place the nose defined
below on top of "base". Save this overlay as
a variable called "no-eyes".
|#
(define nose (isosceles-triangle 30 330 "solid" "orange"))
(define no-eyes
  (overlay nose base))

#| Question 4:
Using the place-image function, place
two eyes on "no-eyes". Save the image
with both eyes placed as "head"

Hint: One eye should be placed at (30, 30),
one eye should be placed at (70, 30)
|#
(define head
  (place-image eye 30 30 (place-image eye 70 30 no-eyes )))
#| Question 5:
Create your snowman!

Using the "above" and "scale" functions,
place the head on top of a base that is scaled
by 1.5, and another base that is scaled by 2.

Save this image as "snowman"
|#
(define snowman
  (above head
  (scale 1.5 base)
  (scale 2 base)))
  #| Question 6:
Make a solid circle of radius 7 of any color you'd like.
Save that circle as a variable called "button"

Using (place-image), place the buttons on your snowman
in any way you'd like. Save the final product
as "final-snowman"
|#
(define button (circle 7 "solid" "black"))
(define cat (place-image button 100 150
            (place-image button 100 200 (place-image button 100 350 snowman))))
cat
#| Bonus Question:
Give your snowman a hat!

Assemble a hat using any combination
of shapes, then use "above"
to place it on your snowman.
|#
(define hat (square 200 "solid" "grey"))
(define
